      This is the JS generated by the `wasm-pack` build command

      The script here will define a `wasm_bindgen` global where all
      functionality can be accessed such as instantiation and the actual
      functions (examples below).

      You can customize the name of the file here with the `out-name` CLI flag
      to `wasm-bindgen`. You can also customize the name of the global exported
      here with the `no-modules-global` flag.

      function outlineLine(text) {
        console.log(text);
      }
      // Import functionality from the wasm module, but note that it's not quite
      // ready to be used just yet.
      const { greet, parse } = wasm_bindgen;

      async function run() {
        // First up we need to actually load the wasm file, so we use the
        // exported global to inform it where the wasm file is located on the
        // server, and then we wait on the returned promies to wait for the
        // wasm to be loaded.
        //
        // Note that instead of a string here you can also pass in an instance
        // of `WebAssembly.Module` which allows you to compile your own module.
        await wasm_bindgen('./pkg/wasm_bg.wasm');

        // And afterwards we can use all the functionality defined in wasm.
