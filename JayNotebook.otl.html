Otlbook has an interactive notebook using the J programming language
	http://jsoftware.com/
Use the VimOutliner preformatted user block to add J code
	<#j
	< 1 + 2
Then pipe your file through `./otlbook.py eval` and it will insert the script output
	<#j md5:45459934a386946e6f76a32587aac2d3
	<    1 + 2
	< 3 
What's going on there?
	The hash digest is added to track what has been evaluated
		The block will not get re-evaluated if the current code's digest is equal to the cached one
		This means that expensive notebook computations don't need to be re-done every time the notebook is updated
	The user input gets indented to three characters
		J language REPL style is to have user input indentend relative to the runtime output
	The result of the expression gets added to the block
You can also provide library code
	<#j-lib
	< is_palindrome=: 3 : 0 "0
	<  (|. 10 #.inv y) -: 10 #.inv y
	< )
	Library code blocks don't get evaluated locally
	They do get added to all subsequent code blocks
	So you can start the file by defining shared library functions, then write computations that use them
	Here's a Project Euler solution using the library verb
		: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
		<#j md5:40c1fd0c4390e001ee7d2351e80bf8e0
		<    nums =: 100+i.900
		<
		<    prods =: , nums */ nums
		<    >./ prods * is_palindrome prods
		< 906609 
	That's also slow to compute, so the hash keeps things
