Otlbook Introduction
	This is the otlbook static single-file wiki front page
	It's also the first node in the VimOutliner source file
	(View the source of this webpage to see what's going on here)
	The convention is that the first node of the VimOutliner file shows up as the display front page.

AboutOtlbook
	Otlbook turns VimOutliner files into static wiki webpages
		https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner
	Write regular outline documents
	Give the files `.otl.html` extension and add the OtlBoilerplate to the bottom of the file
	Use WikiWord-s to name important concepts
		Define a WikiWord by having it be the only text on a line:
			WikiWord
				WikiWord-s are the original way to create wiki structure
				They're two or more words written in SnakeCase
				OtlBook allows numbers in them: Test1234Word

	Standard VimOutliner effects
		Paragraphs of text prefixed with :
			: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut
			: labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco

			: disputationi te, usu in liber putant assueverit. At autem mundi vel.
		Tables with |
			| Header1 | Header2 |
			|---------|---------|
			| 1       | 2       |
			| 3       | 4       |
			(Use https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-table-mode to work with tables in Vim)
		Preformatted text with ;
			; #include <stdio.h>
			; int main() {
			;     printf("Hello, world!\n");
			;     return 0;
			; }
	Other stuff
		Format otl todo items
			[_] TODO
			[X] DONE
	Supported new syntax
		Mark important nodes with trailing asterisk *
		Add inline images with `![image path]`
			![mandrill.jpeg]
	Prospective new syntax
		Not actually supported by the tool, but may be useful to adopt as convention
		Topic tags affect their parent node
			@new-otl-syntax @categorization @help
			A line is considered a tag line if it contains only 1 or more whitespace-separated `@tags`
OtlBoilerplate
	Add the boilerplate line of HTML code to the bottom of the page
	; &lt;style&gt;body{white-space:pre;font-family:monospace}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;script src="otlb.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
	(View page source on this page to see it on this page)
	Add one leading space to stop VimOutliner from thinking it's an user-formatted text object
	Run `otltool.py` to generate the votl.js file in your path
InteractiveNotebook
	The otlbook.py tool supports an offline interactive notebook using JayLanguage
	Use the VimOutliner preformatted user block to add J code
		; <.j
		; < 1 + 2
	Then pipe your file through `./otlbook.py eval` and it will insert the script output
		<.j md5:45459934a386946e6f76a32587aac2d3
		<    1 + 2
		< 3 
		The Vim command to pipe the whole file through the evaluator is something like
			; :%!./otlbook.py eval
	What's going on there?
		The tag is `<.j` instead of `&lt;j`
			Writing the latter without escaping the < with `&amp;lt;` would break the HTML hack mode
			You can drop the . and use `&lt;j` if you are writing regular otl and don't care about the HTML mode
		The hash digest (not visible in the HTML-rendered version) is added to track what has been evaluated
			The block will not get re-evaluated if the current code's digest is equal to the cached one
			This means that expensive notebook computations don't need to be re-done every time the notebook is updated
		The user input gets indented to three characters
			J language REPL style is to have user input indentend relative to the runtime output
		The result of the expression gets added to the block
	You can also provide library code
		<.j-lib
		< is_palindrome=: 3 : 0 "0
		<  (|. 10 #.inv y) -: 10 #.inv y
		< )
		Library code blocks don't get evaluated locally
		They do get added to all subsequent code blocks
		So you can start the file by defining shared library functions, then write computations that use them
		Here's a Project Euler solution using the library verb
			: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
			<.j md5:40c1fd0c4390e001ee7d2351e80bf8e0
			<    nums =: 100+i.900
			<
			<    prods =: , nums */ nums
			<    >./ prods * is_palindrome prods
			< 906609 
		That's slow to compute
		The hash digest keeps updates quick as long as nothing changes with the expensive computation or the libraries leading to it

OtlbookTips
	The HTML layer hack isn't quite perfect
		Things in text that look like they are opening a HTML tag, `&lt;likethis` and not closing it afterwards will break the browser's parser
		Alphabetic characters immediately after the < are the problem
		You need to use `&amp;lt;` in place of the `<` for them
	Make Vim fill the preformatted otl block prefix
		VimOutliner enables prefix filling by marking prefixes as comments
		Tag the preformatted block prefix as comment
		; :se comments+=:<
		Disable autowrapping in comment text
		; :se formatoptions-=c
 <style>body{white-space:pre;font-family:monospace}</style><script src="otlb.js" charset="utf-8"></script><meta charset="utf-8">
 <!-- vim: set filetype=votl : -->
