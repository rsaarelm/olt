Otlbook introduction
	In five seconds
		Look at the source code of this page *
	Slightly longer
		Otlbook is a method for turning a VimOutliner file into a static wiki
		Write a regular VimOutliner outline file, see how you can TurnAnOutlineIntoOtlbook
		OtlbookSyntax is pretty much the same as VimOutliner's, with the addition of the WikiWord support and some other extras
		Use WikiWord-s to structure your outline into OtlArticle-s
		The Otlbook view will show OtlArticle-s in the currently viewed tree as closed nodes and everything else as open
		Click on the closed WikiWord on the current page or a WikiWord link to elsewhere in the outline to move there
		You can display Otlbook documents from a static website or from local disk files, you don't need a server
		So what's the point?
			You get to write your notes in a text editor and store them as text files in version control instead of having to set up an online database server whatsit and having it get hacked, cost you money and eat all your data
			Outlining lets you write lots of crap with little friction
			You can still have a nice wiki-like view to your thing
Table of contents
	OutliningAndWiki
		Outline writing is better for quick notes for self than completed paragraphs
		Wiki is good for linking notes together
		Wiki structure as a trick for folding
			Wiki articles are always shown folded, nothing else is
			It's up to the author to structure the page so that the folding looks sensible at different levels
			This lets us have a folding outline view without actually managing any sort of mutable open/closed fold state
	TurnAnOutlineIntoOtlbook
		Otlbook uses the [./otlb.js] script to convert a static page into HTML at runtime
			Make sure you have the script file present in the same directory where your documents are
		Add OtlBoilerplate to your VimOutliner file
		OtlBoilerplate
			Add UTF-8 marker to the top of the page
			; &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
			Add the boilerplate line of HTML code to the bottom of the page
			; &lt;style&gt;body{white-space:pre;font-family:monospace}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;script src="otlb.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
			(View page source on this page to see it on this page)
			Optionally add a modeline for Vim to show that it should use VimOutliner mode for the file
			; &lt;!-- vim: set filetype=votl: --&gt;
			Add one leading space to the lines stop VimOutliner from thinking it's an user-formatted text object
			Otlbook has a hack where it will not escape HTML codes from leading space indented lines, so this way the lines will also be invisible when rendering the page
	OtlbookSyntax
		Standard VimOutliner syntax
			Paragraphs of text prefixed with :
				: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut
				: labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco
				: laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in
				: voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat
				: non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum
				:
				: Omnes offendit duo ad, repudiare voluptatum theophrastus vim ne. Vel te facilis tacimates
				: referrentur, partiendo deseruisse eam no, velit error melius ne vel. Duo postulant
				: disputationi te, usu in liber putant assueverit. At autem mundi vel.
			Tables with |
				| Header1 | Header2 |
				|---------|---------|
				| 1       | 2       |
				| 3       | 4       |
				(Use https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-table-mode to work with tables in Vim)
			Preformatted text with `;`
				; #include <stdio.h>
				; int main() {
				;     printf("Hello, world!\n");
				;     return 0;
				; }
			Long lines wrap
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum
			Problem with the preformatted user blocks
				VimOutliner uses < for preformatted user text blocks
				However, < next to a letter messes up the HTML hack parsing
				So Otlbook also treats the : and ; VimOutliner blocks as potential user blocks
				The convention is that regular text must always have one space between the text and the block character
				Text next right next to the block separator is treated as user metadata:
					; :latex
					; : $\sum_{i=1}^n i \equiv \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$
					Becomes
					:latex
					: $\sum_{i=1}^n i \equiv \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$
		New syntax
			(View source to see the syntax in action)
			Mark important nodes with trailing asterisk *
				Use this to tag interesting ideas you get in the middle of doing a braindump
			Add inline images with `![image path]`
				![mandrill.jpeg]
			Four or more hyphens make a horizontal rule
			----
			Add local links with `[./path]` (must start with either ./ or ../)
				See the script code at [./otlb.js]
			Well-formed HTML tags on the line will be escaped: <hello> <world>
				Malformed tags with the opening bracket but not the closing one will cause things to break at the web page parsing level, avoid writing those
		Alias links
			You can have aliases to awkward WikiWord names
			The alias is written right below the WikiWord title in parentheses
			The alias is referenced in text in square brackets: [TLA]
				; [TLA]
			ThreeLetterAcronym
				(TLA)
				This title might be annoying to use verbatim everywhere
				It's more commonly referred to as [TLA]
	OtlbookTips
		The OtlArticle title has navigation links to move to its parent articles
		Avoid screwing up your browser's HTML parser
			Things in text that look like they are opening a HTML tag, `&lt;likethis` and not closing it afterwards will break the browser's parser
			Alphabetic characters immediately after the < are the problem
			You need to use `&amp;lt;` in place of the `<` for them
			This hurts with VimOutliner's convention of having preformatted user blocks start with <
				The default format line will trip the browser's HTML parser
				Because of this Otlbook tools just use ; and : for user blocks as well
		Make Vim fill the preformatted otl block prefix
			VimOutliner enables prefix filling by marking prefixes as comments
			Tag the preformatted block prefix as comment
			; :se comments+=:;
			Disable autowrapping in comment text
			; :se formatoptions-=c
		You can use StubWord-s to create link redirects: EveningStar
			The actual definition:
			PlanetVenus
				MorningStar
				EveningStar
				| symbol          | ♀         |
				| orbit           | 0.7 AU    |
				| radius          | 6e6 m     |
				| mass            | 4.8e24 kg |
				| surface gravity | 8.87 ms⁻² |
		Remember that NumbersAreAllowed123
	InteractiveNotebook
		The [./otltool.py] tool supports an offline interactive notebook using JayLanguage
		Use the VimOutliner preformatted user block to add J code
			; ;j
			; ; 1 + 2
		Then pipe your file through `./otltool.py eval` and it will insert the script output
			;j md5:45459934a386946e6f76a32587aac2d3
			;    1 + 2
			; 3 
			The Vim command to pipe the whole file through the evaluator is something like
				; :%!./otltool.py eval
		What's going on there?
			Otlbook uses the ; block style because VimOutliner's < blocks can cause trouble with the browser's HTML parser
			The hash digest (not visible in the HTML-rendered version) is added to track what has been evaluated
				The block will not get re-evaluated if the current code's digest is equal to the cached one
				This means that expensive notebook computations don't need to be re-done every time the notebook is updated
			The user input gets indented to three characters
				J language REPL style is to have user input indented relative to the runtime output
			The result of the expression gets added to the block
		You can also provide library code
			;j-lib
			; is_palindrome=: 3 : 0 "0
			;  (|. 10 #.inv y) -: 10 #.inv y
			; )
			Library code blocks don't get evaluated locally
			They do get added to all subsequent code blocks
			So you can start the file by defining shared library functions, then write computations that use them
			Here's a Project Euler solution using the library verb
				Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
				;j md5:40c1fd0c4390e001ee7d2351e80bf8e0
				;    nums =: 100+i.900
				;
				;    prods =: , nums */ nums
				;    >./ prods * is_palindrome prods
				; 906609 
			That's slow to compute
			The hash digest keeps updates quick as long as nothing changes with the expensive computation or the libraries leading to it
	SpacedRepetitionSupport
		You can embed Anki flashcard data in the outile files for SpacedRepetition
		Flashcard items are marked by terminating the otl line with a period
		As you can see from this file, normally otl lines never have a period in the end
		Run `otltool.py anki` to generate Anki cards from otl files in your working directly
			This loads the cards encoded in your otl files into your default Anki deck
			If it finds cards with matching fronts but different backs, it rewrites the backs of the cards
			If it finds cards with fronts not in your input set in the deck, it suspends these cards
				The idea is that you maintain your entire deck in the otl files and can refactor the cards and have the old cards get removed from your review cycle
			You need to have the Ankiconnect add-on installed for the command to work
				https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159
		Two formats are supported
			Question and answer on separate lines
				; The question ends in a question mark?
				; 	The answer is the only child to the question and ends in a period.
				This generates a card with the question on the front and the answer on the back
			Cloze style
				; Single leaf node ending in period with {{cloze items}} enclosed in {{curly brackets}}.
				This generates one card for each cloze group with that group replaced with ellipsis on the card front
	OtherTopics
		OtlArticle
			An article is a fragment of the VimOutliner file tree that starts with a solitary WikiWord
			It is then considered the article defining that WikiWord
			Articles can be nested
		WikiWord
			Otlbook uses the WikiWord convention from the original Wiki Wiki Web
				http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiWord
			Also NumbersAreAllowed123
			A WikiWord in Otlbook that has no contents inside it is called a
			StubWord
			When you are linked to a StubWord you are shown its parent OtlArticle instead
		NumbersAreAllowed123
			One difference to traditional WikiWord-s, Otlbook allows numbers along with lower case letters
			This lets you mark citation links with a year, Cunningham01WikiWay
			It's also useful for diary entries, DiaryEntry19047
				YearWeekWeekday timestamps are nice and short
				You save one entire character compared to writing something boring like 190127 for 2019-01-27
		YearWeekWeekday
			So what's with the timestamps like 19047?
				; $ date +%g%V%u -d'2019-01-27'
				; 19047
				That's YYWWD,
					YY: Last two digits of year of ISO week number
					WW: ISO week number
					D: Weekday number starting with 1 = Monday
				It's a lot shorter to type than 20190127 if you can't use punctuation
			Okay assume this will become a respectable niche timestamp, what do we do in 2100 when the two year digits roll over?
				Start treating the year part as current year minus 2000, add a 1 to the front
				2100-01-04 becomes 100011
			How do I turn them back into yyyy-mm-dd dates?
				Why would anyone want to do that?
				Well fine, GNU date doesn't seem to be able to do it, but you can do this:
				(Must have Python 3.6 or newer)
				; $ alias weektoiso="python -c \"import sys;from datetime import datetime;print(str(datetime.strptime(str(2000000+int(sys.argv[1])),'%G%V%u')).split()[0])\""
				;	$ weektoiso 19047
				; 2019-01-27
